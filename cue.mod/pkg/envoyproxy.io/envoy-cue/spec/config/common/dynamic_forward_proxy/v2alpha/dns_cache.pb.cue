	// [#comment:TODO(mattklein123): Figure out how to support IPv4/IPv6 "happy eyeballs" mode. The
	// way this might work is a new lookup family which returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and
	// then configures a host to have a primary and fall back address. With this, we could very
	// likely build a "happy eyeballs" connection pool which would race the primary / fall back
	// address and return the one that wins. This same method could potentially also be used for

	// The DNS refresh rate for currently cached DNS hosts. If not specified defaults to 60s.
	//
	// .. note:
	//
	//  The returned DNS TTL is not currently used to alter the refresh rate. This feature will be
	//  added in a future change.

	// The refresh rate is rounded to the closest millisecond, and must be at least 1ms.
	dns_refresh_rate?: string
	// The TTL for hosts that are unused. Hosts that have not been used in the configured time
	// interval will be purged. If not specified defaults to 5m.
	//
	// .. note:
	//
	//   The TTL is only checked at the time of DNS refresh, as specified by *dns_refresh_rate*. This
	//   means that if the configured TTL is shorter than the refresh rate the host may not be removed
	//   immediately.

	//   The TTL has no relation to DNS TTL and is only used to control Envoy's resource usage.

	// The maximum number of hosts that the cache will hold. If not specified defaults to 1024.
	//
	// .. note:
	//
	//   The implementation is approximate and enforced independently on each worker thread, thus
	//   it is possible for the maximum hosts in the cache to go slightly above the configured
	//   value depending on timing. This is similar to how other circuit breakers work.
	max_hosts?: uint32

	// this is used as the cache's DNS refresh rate when DNS requests are failing. If this setting is
	// not specified, the failure refresh rate defaults to the dns_refresh_rate.
